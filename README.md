# YouTube Sponsored Video Hider Extension

## Overview
Hides all the "sponsored" videos in YouTube. It runs as an extension in your browser and reduces their opacity to 10%. The outcome is that the videos are still present, but they get pushed far into the background of your cognitive view.

## How to run this
1. Clone this repo locally
2. Open Microsft Edge and browse to `edge://extensions`
3. Turn on "Developer Mode"
4. Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the folder of your locally clone extension project.
